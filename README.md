# BMI Calculator

The Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measurement of body fat using height and weight. To calculate BMI you would divide the body mass by the square of the body height.

Metric BMI Equation:
`weight (kg) / [height (m)] ** 2 OR`
`[weight (kg) / height (cm) / height (cm)] * 10,000`

Imperial/English BMI Equation:
`weight (lb) / [height (in)] ** 2 * 703`
